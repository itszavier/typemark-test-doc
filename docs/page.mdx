# 👋 Welcome to Markbase Docs

This is the main entry point for your documentation.

You can:

- Browse pages in the sidebar
- Use markdown and MDX to write rich content
- Organize content into folders and files

## 📁 Folder Structure

Your current structure might look like:

```
docs/
├── auth/
│   ├── login.mdx
│   └── signup.mdx
├── guide/
│   ├── getting-started.mdx
│   └── deploying.mdx
└── page.mdx
```

## 🚀 Quick Tips

- Use frontmatter (`---`) at the top of your files
- The `slug` defines the URL path
- Keep titles short and descriptive
